## Basic Typeclass

1. Eq
  * == and /=
2. Ord
  * <,>,<=,>=
  * compare :: Ord a => a -> a -> Ordering (LT,GT,EQ)
3. Show
  * It takes a value whose type is a member of Show and presents it to us as a string.
  * ```show "True"```
4. Read
  * The read function takes a string and returns a type which is a member of Read.
  * ```read "4" + 3.8 ```
  *  use **type annotations** to explicitly specify the type <br />
  ```read "5" :: Int```c
  ```read "(3, 'a')" :: (Int, Char) ```
5. Enum
  * Enum members are sequentially ordered types
  * Types in this class: (), Bool, Char, Ordering, Int, Integer, Float and Double.
  * succ, pred
  * ``` ['a' .. 'z']``` ```[LT .. GT]```
6. Bounded
  * Bounded members have an upper and a lower bound.
  * maxBound, minBound
  * All tuples are also part of Bounded if the components are also in it.
7. Num
  * Types in this class: Int, Integer, Float, Double
  * To join Num, a type must already be friends with Show and Eq.
8. Integral
  * Types in this class: Int, Integer
  * Use **fromIntegral** to parse Integral to Num, ```fromIntegral (length [1,2,3,4]) + 3.2```
9. Floating
  * Types in this class: Float, Double

##Elegant of Haskell

1. Fibonacci
  ```haskell
  fibs :: [Integer]
  fibs = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibs (tail fibs)
  ```

2. QuickSort
  ```haskell
  quicksort :: (Ord a) => [a] -> [a]
  quicksort []     = []
  quicksort (x:xs) =
      let smallerSorted = quicksort [a | a <- xs , a <= x]
          biggerSorted = quicksort [a | a <- xs, a > x]
      in smallerSorted ++ [x] ++ biggerSorted
  ```

##Three rules of Lambda Calculus

* a variable, x, is itself a valid lambda term
* if t is a lambda term, and x is a variable, then (Î»x.t) is a lambda term (called a lambda abstraction);
* if t and s are lambda terms, then (ts) is a lambda term (called an application).

##Higher Order Functions

* **Definition**: Haskell functions can take functions as parameters and return functions as return values. A function that does either of those is called a higher order function.
* **Curried functions**:All the functions that accepted several parameters so far have been curried functions.
  <br/>Putting a space between two things is simply **function application**.
  <br/>The space is sort of like an operator and it has the highest precedence.
  <br/> Let's examine the type of max. It's max :: (Ord a) => a -> a -> a.
  <br/>That can also be written as max :: (Ord a) => a -> (a -> a). That could be read as: max takes an a and returns (that's the ->) a function that takes an a and returns an a. That's why the return type and the parameters of functions are all simply separated with arrows.
* **map,filter and folds**
    * map::(a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
    takes a function and a list and applies that function to every element in the list, producing a new list.
    * filter::(a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
    takes a predicate (a predicate is a function that tells whether something is true or not, so in our case, a function that returns a boolean value) and a list and then returns the list of elements that satisfy the predicate.
    * folds (foldl::(a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a and foldr::(a -> b -> b) -> b -> [a] -> b): we usually use right folds when we're building up new lists from a list.
    <br/> Folds can be used to implement any function where you traverse a list once, element by element, and then return something based on that. Whenever you want to traverse a list to return something, chances are you want a fold.

##Type, Kind and Info
1. Type

    use ```:t``` on a value to get its type
2. Kind

    use ```:k``` on a type (or a typeclass) to get its kind
3. Info

    use ```:info```(or ```:i```) on a typeclass/type to get its definition and instances, or a function to get its definition.
4. Browse

    use ```:browse``` to list a module

##I/O Action
1. return () :
they make I/O actions that don't really do anything except have an encapsulated result and that result is thrown away because it isn't bound to a name. We can use return in combination with <- to bind stuff to names.
<br/>return is sort of the opposite to <-. While return takes a value and wraps it up in a box, <- takes a box (and performs it) and takes the value out of it, binding it to a name. But doing this is kind of redundant, especially since you can use let bindings in do blocks to bind to names

2. putStr,putStrLn,putChar: Output String -> IO ()
<br/> print = putStrLn . show

3. getStr,getStrLn,getChar: Input IO() -> String

4. sequence:: [IO a] -> IO [a]
```
main = do
  rs <- sequence [getLine,getLine,getLine]
  print rs

  sequence (map print[1..5])
```

5. mapM = sequence . map
<br/> mapM_ = mapM (omit the result of IO action)

6. forever: takes an I/O action and returns an I/O action that just repeats the I/O action it got forever.
```
import Control.Monad
import Data.Char
main = forever $ do
  putStr "Give me some imput: "
  l <- getLine
  putStrLn $ map toUpper l
```

7. forM:is like mapM, only that it has its parameters switched around.

8. openFile :: FilePath -> IOMode -> IO Handle
  <br/>FilePath = String
  <br/>data IOMode = ReadMode | WriteMode | AppendMode | ReadWriteMode

9. withFile :: FilePath -> IOMode -> (Handle -> IO a) -> IO a

10. readFile, writeFile, appendFile

11. hGetContents, hClose

12. hSetBuffering
<br/> BufferMode = NoBuffering | LineBuffering | BlockBuffering (Maybe Int)

13. hFlush: flush buffer
